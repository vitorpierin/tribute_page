        <p>Philip Andrew Irons (July 24, 1978 â€“ November 2, 2010) was an American professional surfer. Irons began surfing with his brother Bruce on the shallow and dangerous waves of Kauai, Hawaii, before being spotted by a local surfboard brand and flown to North Shore, Oahu, Hawaii, to compete and develop his skill.</p>

        <p>His younger brother, Bruce Irons, is a former competitor on the World Championship Tour of Surfing. During his childhood, Andy regularly lost to Bruce in contests, but that changed once he entered the World Championship Tour. During his professional career, he won three world titles (2002, 2003, 2004), three Quiksilver Pro France titles (2003, 2004, 2005), two Rip Curl Pro Search titles (2006 and 2007) and 20 elite-tour victories, including the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing four times from 2002-2006. On September 3, 2010, he won the Billabong Pro Teahupoo in Tahiti.

            In 2009, Irons withdrew from doing the full ASP World Tour season for personal reasons, though he did participate in a few events. He requested a wildcard entry for the 2010 ASP World Tour season, which was granted by ASP President Wayne Bartholomew. As a result, Irons did not have to re-qualify in 2010 via the World Qualifying Series (WQS). Irons won the Billabong Pro Tahiti 2010.[5]
            
            He was inducted into the Surfing Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, California, in 2008.[6] The Governor of Hawaii declared February 13 forever "Andy Irons Day."[7] He was the only surfer to have won a title at every venue on the ASP calendar.
